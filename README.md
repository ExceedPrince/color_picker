# color_picker

This is a solo exercise from the CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.
In this case I received a half complete color picker. The design is not a big deal, but this application did not work at all.
It was my job to write functions and make it work as it supposed to.

The tricky part was to convert the data between RGB and hexadecimal codes. And optionally convert to binary code as well.

At this time I used Javascript.
